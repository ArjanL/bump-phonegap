bump-phonegap
=============

Bump nicely wrapped into phonegap.  Should work out of the box.  You will need an API key for this to work properly.


How to use

1. Update the API key with your own  file Plugins/Ios/bump.m
3. To be able to run this in a real device update the Bundle Identifier with your own.



Some known problem. 

1. When run in a real device sometimes it takes time to connect to bump server, you can try running first it in the emulator
